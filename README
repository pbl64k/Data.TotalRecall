Data.TotalRecall is a prototype Haskell library for working with mnemonic
values and operations. This currently lacks pretty much everything that
could make it actually useful (such as HOFs and mnemonic lambdas), but it
demonstrates the concept fairly well.

test.hs will create a set .xml files with the results of sample
calculations.

xml2xhtml will transform these files into an XHTML1 page for reviewing
the values and memories in a human-readable form. xml2xhtml requries
xsltproc.
